### Accessing exercise data files

Excercises 6, 7, 8, and 11 use data files and scripts. We've included copies of those files and scripts in the `training_files/` directory.

### Viewing examples in the test.ai application:
To review the code in-app, clone this repository into your user directory, and rename the directory to 'test_ai':

`git@github.com:Appdiff/interactive_walkthrough.git test_ai`

and restart the test.ai application. If you already have a test_ai folder in place:

- Download this repository
